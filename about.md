# Hello, my name is Sofia Noejovich! 


I currently work as a technology consultant at Microsoft, pursuing data engineering and data science projects with customers. My mission is to bring data-driven, empathic products to enable businesses and users to do their best work. 


I am also an avid triathlete, cyclist, skier, and writer. I love to write about my learnings in data science, data engineering, cycling, and triathlon, in the hopes that they might benefit someone in their journey.
